New features:
* The application is renamed to RhizoVision Explorer to reflect the huge revamp
  in the UI. The UI is expanded from only a batch processer for directories of 
  images to a fully interactive tool. The application consists of a main window
  consisting of menus, toolbar and several panes such as analysis options, 
  features, log, and ROI Manager. This functionality provided by cvutil library
  contains the following features.
  1.  Supports drag & drop of images to load.
  2.  Supports image panning and zooming.
  3.  Allows user to inspect pixel values in five different color spaces
      such as RGB, HSV, HLS, Lab and Luv.
  4.  Supports drawing Region-of-Interest (ROI) rectangles on the image
      to highlight important portions.
  5.  User can query pixel statistics of a loaded image in five different
      color spaces (mentioned above), either on an entire image, or the
      locations specified by ROIs. The statistics include mean and SD of
      the color channels.
  6.  The ROI subsystem supports selecting, moving, resizing and deleting
      multiple ROIs. Deleting the ROIs can be done using the delete key.
      Ctrl+A selects all the ROIs. All the ROIs can be deleted from the 
      menu using Edit->ROI->Clear all ROIs.
  7.  The ROI subsystem also supports exporting and importing the ROIs as
      annotations in a text file.
  8.  The ROI Manager pane to the right of the main Window shows the ROIs
      that are currently present on the image. Selecting an ROI shows its 
      dimensions, which can be edited in the pane.
  9.  The main window supports plugin system. When a plugin is loaded, its
      settings are populated to the left of the main window. Plugins are
      independent modules that implement a specific procedure/method/algorithm
      that can be attached to and configured frim inside the main window.
  10. Main window supports browsing images in the same folder using left 
      and right arrow keys.
  11. Supports "Analyze" button in the toolbar, that invokes the current 
      plugin loaded to perform analysis on the loaded image.
  12. The main window has a log pane for logging info/warning/error messages
      and a features pane to display any extracted features from the plugin.
      Both the panes are located at the bottom of the main window.
  13. The main window supports color inversion and 90 degree rotation of
      a loaded image.
  14. If the current plugin has multiple outputs, these outputs can be 
      browsed from the toolbar of the main window or by pressing SPACE key.
      SPACE key toggles the image displayed between input image and multiple
      output images.
* The RhizoVision Explorer supports feature extraction from both root crown and
  broken root images that were acquired using flatbed scanner using Whole root 
  and Brokwn root modes respectively.
* The analysis options pane includes options for image pre-processing, feature 
  extraction and output display.
* The program can now convert pixels from mm using DPI value.
* The program assumes the roots are darker and the background is brighter.
  Noise can be filtered by keeping largest connected component, filtering 
  smaller dark components by size (non-roots) or filtering brighter components
  on dark components by size (fill roots).
* Edge smoothing is now optional.
* Feature extraction options include root pruning. Root pruning is a method 
  where the lateral roots with root tips whose length is within the root diameter
  at the connecting branch plus the number of pixels given by the user.
* Feature extraction options also include setting diameter ranges. A maximum 
  of 10 ranges can be set.
* User can configure how an output image can be displayed using output display
  options. This can be done using output display options.
* After analysis the relevant features from either whole root or broken roots
  are extracted and populated in the Features pane at the bottom of the main 
  window.
* A histogram pane shows after running analysis that shows the total length in 
  each diameter bin and updates with new analysis
* Help has an About dialog with information about the version, license, and 
  contact information.
* The program now extracts histograms of root length, projected area, surface
  area and volume with bins as the diameter ranges given by the user in the
  Analysis options pane.
* While extracting features of an image in interactive mode, a prograss bar
  shows the amount of progress and the steps currently running on the image.
* If the images are taken in a different rotation, they can be rotated and 
  analyzed within the program.
* If Region-of-Interests (ROIs) are drawn on an image, the program only analyzes
  the image data in the ROIs. This may be helpful, when cropping borders or
  if an image has multiple root samples that require separate processing.
  The batch analysis also applies the existing ROIs to every image in the 
  folder before analyzing.
* The program now supports root pruning. Enabling the pruning option with 
  a threshold level discards root segments greater than the radius of the 
  parent segment plus the threshold level.

Fixes:
* main.cpp: Fixed type casting variables from unsigned int to signed int.
* MainUI.cpp: Fixed loading/saving image paths to use QFile instead of fstream
  to fix errors when the path has non-English characters.

Version 1.0:
-----------
New features:
------------
* Modified feature extraction function to extract features in two separate threads.
* Calculated area of convex polygon without drawing the pixels in a separate image.
* Added About dialog box.
* Added in-program documentation. It can be accessed by clicking '?' symbol at the 
  top right corner and clicking the user interface controls.
* Added support for file types: PNG, JPG, BMP, JPEG, JPE, DIB, JP2, TIFF, TIF.
* The program now saves the user options in a separate metadata.csv in the same 
  output folder along with features.csv for future reference.
* Added icons and logo to the software.

Issues fixed:
------------
* Replaced conventional rand() function from C to random_device in C++ for longer 
  periodicity.
* Fixed program to crop empty regions before performing analysis to improve speed.
* Before extracting median and maximum root numbers, the program now skips zeros 
  from the list of root numbers from each rows.
* Fixed estimation of Perimeter, where the program computed the sum of distances 
  between contour points excluding the segment that connects first and last contour 
  points in a circular contour.
* Average and median diameter is now zero for an empty image where the program 
  previously crashed for the input.
* Fixed estimation of volume and surface area of plant root so that the extracted 
  feature is invariant to rotation of image. This issue was observed when an image 
  was created containing manually drawn straight line of same length but at different 
  angles was passed to RhizoVision Analyzer.
* The program now saves root diameters (average, median and maximum) instead of 
  radii for easier verification by end users.
* Fixed generation of orientation histograms as the program iterates only a few 
  points due to wrong loop condition.
* Fixed generation of orientation histograms where the program crashed when the 
  root segment has only one pixel.
* The program is fixed to check the availability of Intel AVX 2.0 instruction set 
  and enable vector acceleration accordingly.
* Fixed estimation of maximum diameter to scan all skeletal pixels and select the 
  location of the pixel having maximum diameter that has highest row index (or 
  greatest depth).

Version 0.91
------------
New features:
------------
* Added UI option to save binary segmented images.
* Added two new features - Number of Root Tips and Average Root Angle.
* Added UI controls to set diameter ranges.
* Added UI controls to manually set the threshold level.

Issues fixed:
------------
* Fixed issues where ghost skeletons are created.
* Fixed issue in skeletonization where the ridges were not connected to the main ridge 
  due to mis-identification of ridge endpoints.
* The distanceTransform() on OpenCV returns wrong distances (for precise Euclidean 
  distances) for pixels with location greater than 4096 rows or columns. This may 
  make harder to compute distance transforms for larger sized images. Although 
  OpenCV is open-source, it internally calls functions from Intel's proprietary 
  library called Intel Performance Premitives (IPP) to compute the precise Euclidean 
  distance transforms. Currently implemented the same algorithm as referred in IPP 
  manually.

Version 0.9
-----------
New features:
------------
* The program is converted to a GUI. The feature extraction runs on a separate thread, 
  while progress is shown on main window.
* The user can specify in the window, the location of the images to be processed and 
  the output location.
* The program can optionally output processed images.
* The program can optionally convert features from pixel units to physical units (millimeters).
* An additional feature 'Average Hole Size' is extracted from the plant root images.

Issues fixed:
------------
* demo.h:getnearestcomponents() - Fixed an issue where nearest components were wrongly 
  assigned.
* main.cpp:getcoarsefineroots() - The coarse, medium and fine roots are returned as 
  fraction of the total number of roots.
* main.cpp:getshallowdeeproots() - The shallow, medium and deep roots are returned as 
  fraction of the total number of roots.
* main.cpp:feature_extractor() - Fixed the function to convert features from pixel units 
  to physical units (millimeters).
* roottopology.cpp:getroottolopogy() - Fixed a memory leak issue, that leads to large 
  memory allocation of the order of 9 GB when the program is run on 4000 images.

Version 0.1
-----------
* Initial creation.
* The program runs in console window and extracts plant root features from each image in a specified directory.
